\arguments{
\item{train_data}{Training data set from \code{make_groups()}.}

\item{test_data}{Testing data set from \code{make_groups()}.}

\item{variable}{The variable to predict. Default is "Disease".}

\item{case}{Case to predict.}

\item{cor_threshold}{Threshold of absolute correlation values. This will be used to remove the minimum number of features so that all their resulting absolute correlations are less than this value.}

\item{normalize}{Whether to normalize numeric data to have a standard deviation of one and a mean of zero. Default is TRUE.}

\item{cv_sets}{Number of cross-validation sets. Default is 5.}

\item{grid_size}{Size of the grid for hyperparameter optimization. Default is 10.}

\item{ncores}{Number of cores to use for parallel processing. Default is 4.}

\item{hypopt_vis}{Whether to visualize hyperparameter optimization results. Default is TRUE.}

\item{exclude_cols}{Columns to exclude from the data before the model is tuned. Default is NULL.}

\item{seed}{Seed for reproducibility. Default is 123.}

A list with five elements:
\itemize{
\item xgboost_tune: Hyperparameter optimization results.
\item xgboost_wf: Workflow object.
\item train_set: Training set.

\description{
\code{xgboost_hypopt()} tunes an XGBoost model and performs hyperparameter optimization.
It uses the xgboost engine for logistic regression and tunes the number of trees,
tree depth, minimum number of data points in a node, loss reduction, sample size,
and number of predictors randomly sampled at each split. For the hyperparameter optimization,
it uses the \code{grid_space_filling()} function from the dials package.
